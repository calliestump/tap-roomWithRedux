<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

* As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg.
* As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
* As a user, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone!
* I should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all flavors and treats. Users should be able to click on an individual flavor or treat to see all the flavors/treats that belong to it.
* As a user, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of pints left.
* As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!)
